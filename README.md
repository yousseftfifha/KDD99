AI in intrusion detection is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to detect malicious activity on a computer network. AI-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) are designed to detect malicious activity by analyzing network traffic and identifying patterns that indicate malicious behavior. AI-based IDS can detect both known and unknown threats, as well as identify suspicious behavior that may indicate an attack. AI-based IDS can also be used to detect insider threats, such as employees who are accessing sensitive data without authorization. AI-based IDS can also be used to detect anomalies in network traffic, such as unusually high volumes of traffic or unusual patterns of communication.
